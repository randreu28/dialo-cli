## Try it!

Make sure you have Deno installed. If you don't have it installed, you may refer
to the
[Deno docs](https://deno.land/manual@v1.35.2/getting_started/installation)

`deno run --allow-net https://deno.land/x/llama_cli@v1.0.1/main.ts`

> Funny story, it was originally called llama CLI, but due to the ammount of
> restrictions the so-called "open source" Llama AI has, I decided to use
> microsoft's IA instead.
